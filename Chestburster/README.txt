# Summary

This is a Remix of the chestburster, I did not make the model. I just added a hole in the bottom and modelled an attachment to fit with a gopro chest mount. 

The original model is from MustangDave and this piece is a remix from Geoffros "Alien Chestburster Halloween prop"
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:500093

The gopro part that is going in to the alien is a little smaller than the actual hole in the alien. 
I made it so to make the alien a bit easier to remove. (like when having the chest mount under your shirt and you want to put a jacket on. you can just take the alien off, leave the mount on, and then zip up your jacket)

Just use some tape to build up the thickness of the gopro part and the alien will fit just fine :D

# AlienCuckooClock
A re-imagining of the cuckoo clock inspired by the H. R. Giger aesthetic. The main components of the clock will utilize the Xenomorph life stages as seen in the Alien franchise with the Facehugger serving as the clock face, the Chestburster as the cuckoo, and the human host as the main body of the clock.
